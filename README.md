# Git GUI

(name pending)

This repository contains a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) project for a visual Git UI.

The main goal is for it to be lightweight and fast, while still being visually appealing. It should make it easier working with git repositories without the need for Git CLI, while also teaching how Git works for new joiners.

## Status

Currently in small development as a side project. At the moment of writing this, it only can git fetch, list commits, render them and create new commits, but it doesn't show the diff of changes yet.

It ain't much, but it's honest work

## Development

As mentioned, this is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) project. The UI is made with SolidJS in the folder `src`. The BE is in Rust and it's in `src-tauri`.

You'll need to have Rust and NodeJS installed.
